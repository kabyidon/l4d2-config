// "If you're recording new footage, and have a Sourcemod-enabled server or local client, you can set nb_update_frequency 0 to force AI-controlled infected to update every tick instead of every third tick. This can help the smoothness in playback of the demo. Note that this can't be done for existing demos--you have to set nb_update_frequency 0 when you're making the demo."

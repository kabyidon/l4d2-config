## Recommended Sourcemods

Some VScript mods have replaced Sourcemod ones, these are for the rest:

- [Scene Processor](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2766130&postcount=59%29): This allows the "Vocalize" command to be unblocked. 
- [Teammate Flashlight](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=186558&page=7) or [this one](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2825161&postcount=67): The latest and greatest way to have teammate flashlights, there doesn't seem to be a vscript version
